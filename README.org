This is a Halloween take on the game [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqi][Banqi]] - or dark (or blind, or half) chess.

The point of the game is to be the last player that can make a valid move (including flipping pieces up).
This can be done by either:
 - eliminating the other players pieces so they cannot move
 - trapping the other players pieces so they cannot legally move

It uses the Jumping cannon rules, where the wraith --or cannon in traditional banqi-- must jump over 1 and only 1 piece to move or capture.


The pixel art was drawn by my super talented spouse [[https://github.com/catspook/graveyard-pics][catspook]]!

** To play:
*** Prepackaged builds
    If you don't want to install racket or the library dependencies there are prepackaged builds in [[https://github.com/thea-leake/graveyard/releases][releases]].
    They may not be up to date with master though.
*** Building or running from source
**** Dependencies:
    If you do not want to use the prepackaged build you will need:
    - Racket - you can download [[https://download.racket-lang.org][here]]

    - Libraries -- either:
      - =raco pkg install memoize table-panel=, /or/
      - =make deps=

**** Run from source without building:
  - run: =racket graveyard/start_view.rkt= in this directory, or
  - =make run=
**** With building:
 This should give a better startup time, and will build a portable executable.
  - to build a local build run =make executable=.  This will build an executable in =build/bin=
  - to make a distributable build run:
    + =make build_<OS_TYPE>= this will build a distributable executable in =build/target=
      + OSX: =osx= - so command would be =make build_osx=
      + Linux/UNIX: =unix=
      + Windows: =windows=

***** To remove build artifacts:
   Run =make clean=.


** How to play:
The necromancers are presented with a graveyard full of buried corpses.
Each player then either raises a corpse, or moves/captures one of the other necromancers corpses.

The game ends when one player can no longer move or raise a new corpse.


Each corpse (except the wraith--as specified in its role section) can move one plot horizontally or vertically.
Capturing is done by moving into the plot another raised piece is in.
The hierarchy of what corpse can capture what is defined below in roles.

*** Roles
    These are ordered by precedence from least to greatest vulnerability.
**** Lich

     The lich can capture any unit except poltergeists as poltergeists don't have enough of a presence for the lich to control them.
     The lich is vulnerable to other liches, poltergeists, and wraiths.
**** Vampire
     The vampire is vulnerable to units above it and other vampires, and can capture units below it and other vampires
**** Zombie
     The zombie is vulnerable to units above it and other zombies, and can capture units below it and other zombies
**** Ghoul
     The ghoul is vulnerable to units above it and other ghouls, and can capture units below it and other ghouls
**** Skeleton
     The skeleton is vulnerable to units above it and other skeletons, and can capture units below it and other skeletons
**** Wraith
     The wraith is a glass cannon, capable of capturing any unit, but capturable by any except the poltergeist.
     To give the wraith the energy it needs to move or capture, it must latch on to the essence of another creature, and move through it.
     As such the wraith must skip over one (and only one) corpse on the board on either axis to move.
**** Poltergeist
     The poltergeist can do little more than bat objects around, but their mischievous behavior is perfectly suited for stealing and breaking a liches philactory!
     The poltergeist can only capture liches and other poltergeists, and are vulnerable to all other units
